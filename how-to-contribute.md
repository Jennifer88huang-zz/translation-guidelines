# First Contributions
It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn and contribute for the first time.

## How to contribute
If you don't know how to use Git or how to make a pull request, refer to [First Contributions in Open Source project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
If you are not comfortable with tutorial, you can also watch a video on [Make a Pull Request](http://makeapullrequest.com/).

## 第一次参与开源项目
如果你还不太熟悉 Git，GitHub，不知道怎么提 Pull Request 参与开源项目，请参考[第一次参与开源项目](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions/blob/master/translations/README.chs.md).

## Benefits on Contribution
