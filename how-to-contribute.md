# First Contributions
It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn and contribute for the first time.

## How to contribute
If you don't know how to use Git or make a pull request, refer to [First Contributions in Open Source project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
If you are not comfortable with tutorial, you can also watch a video on [Make a Pull Request](http://makeapullrequest.com/).

## More information
You might encounter many issues when getting started the first time. Do not feel depressed, whether it's related to tools, styles, commands, operation system, or others. Those issues also bother other newcomers. You can find answers [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), or search on GitHub. Feel free to open a issue, or contact [us](https://github.com/streamnative/translation-guidelines/blob/master/Contributor.md), we're glad to help you.
